# Drum Kit

This project exemplifies the implementation of event listeners for buttons and keystrokes to detect which key in particular was pressed by the user.

The way this works is we have a bunch of keys here that represent different drums in a typical drum kit. And when you click on any of these buttons, you will get the corresponding drum sound. In addition, you can also use keyboard keys.
